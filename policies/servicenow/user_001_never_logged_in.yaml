title: "Active user account that has never logged in"
description: >
  A user account is active but has never logged in (last_login_time is empty).
  Unused active accounts expand the attack surface unnecessarily. They may
  represent orphaned accounts from automated provisioning, test accounts left
  active, or accounts created for users who never onboarded.

remediation: >
  Disable or lock user accounts that have never logged in after a reasonable
  provisioning period (e.g., 30 days). Implement automated account lifecycle
  management to detect and disable unused accounts. Review the account
  creation source to fix upstream provisioning issues.
