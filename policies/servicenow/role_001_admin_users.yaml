title: "Users with admin role"
description: >
  Lists all users who have been assigned the admin role. The admin role provides
  full system access and should be strictly limited. A high number of admin
  users significantly increases the attack surface.

remediation: >
  Minimize the number of admin role assignments. Review each admin user and
  determine if they truly need full admin access. Create specific roles for
  different administrative functions (e.g. user_admin, security_admin) and
  assign those instead. Aim for fewer than 5 admin users in production.
