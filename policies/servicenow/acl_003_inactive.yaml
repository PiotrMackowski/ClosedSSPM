title: "Inactive ACL that was previously active"
description: >
  An ACL rule has been deactivated. While this is not inherently a vulnerability,
  deactivated ACLs may indicate a change in security posture that should be
  reviewed. Attackers sometimes deactivate ACLs to bypass security controls.
severity: MEDIUM
category: ACL

    - field: "active"

      value: "false"
remediation: >
  Review all inactive ACLs to determine if they were intentionally deactivated.
  If they are no longer needed, consider deleting them. If they were accidentally
  deactivated, reactivate them. Document the reason for any intentionally
  deactivated ACLs.
