title: "ACL with admin overrides enabled"
description: >
  An ACL rule has the 'admin_overrides' flag set to true. While this is the
  default behavior, it means admin users bypass this ACL entirely. In
  environments where admin accounts may be compromised, this increases the
  blast radius. This is informational for audit completeness.

  For ACLs protecting highly sensitive data (PII, financial records, audit logs),
  consider disabling admin overrides so that even admin users must pass the
  ACL conditions. This requires enabling the High Security plugin.
