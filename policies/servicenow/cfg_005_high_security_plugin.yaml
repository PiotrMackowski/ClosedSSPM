title: "High security plugin not activated"
description: >
  The High Security Settings plugin (com.glide.security.high) provides
  enhanced security controls including stricter session management, additional
  input validation, and tighter default ACLs. If this plugin is not active,
  the instance is missing an important layer of defense-in-depth.

  Activate the High Security Settings plugin. Review the plugin documentation
  for any behavioral changes that may affect existing functionality. Test
  thoroughly in a sub-production instance before activating in production.
  This is considered a baseline security requirement by ServiceNow.
