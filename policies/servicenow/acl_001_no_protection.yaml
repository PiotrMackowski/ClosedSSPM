title: "ACL with no condition, no script, and no role requirement"
description: >
  An ACL rule has no condition, no script, and no required roles. This means
  all authenticated users can access the protected resource regardless of their
  role. This is the most permissive ACL configuration possible and is almost
  always a misconfiguration.
severity: CRITICAL
category: ACL
platform: servicenow
query:
  table: sys_security_acl
  field_conditions:
    - field: "condition"
      operator: "empty"
    - field: "script"
      operator: "empty"
    - field: "active"
      operator: "equals"
      value: "true"
remediation: >
  Add an explicit condition or script to the ACL, or assign specific required
  roles. Review the resource this ACL protects and determine the minimum set of
  roles that should have access. Never leave all three (condition, script, roles)
  empty on an active ACL.
