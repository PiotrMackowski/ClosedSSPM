title: "Web service endpoint with authentication disabled"
description: >
  A web service definition has requires_authentication set to false, allowing
  unauthenticated access. This exposes the endpoint to the public internet
  and could allow data exfiltration or unauthorized operations without any
  credential requirement.
severity: CRITICAL

query:
  table: sys_ws_definition
  field_conditions:
    - field: "requires_authentication"

      value: "true"
remediation: >
  Enable authentication on all web service endpoints. Set requires_authentication
  to true and configure appropriate ACLs to restrict access to authorized
  roles only. If anonymous access is truly required, document the business
  justification and add IP allowlisting at the network layer.
