title: "ACL allows unauthenticated access via public type"
description: >
  An ACL rule is configured with a type that allows public/unauthenticated
  access. This means the protected resource can be accessed without any
  authentication, potentially exposing sensitive data to the internet.
severity: HIGH
category: ACL
platform: servicenow
query:
  table: sys_security_acl
  field_conditions:
    - field: "type"
      operator: "contains"
      value: "public"
    - field: "active"
      operator: "equals"
      value: "true"
remediation: >
  Review all public-type ACLs and ensure they only protect resources that are
  intentionally public-facing. Service Catalog items and Knowledge Base articles
  exposed through Service Portal should be carefully reviewed for data leakage.
  Remove public access unless explicitly required.
