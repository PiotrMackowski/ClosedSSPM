title: "IP address access control not configured"
description: >
  The system property glide.ip.access.control or similar IP restriction
  properties are not configured. Without IP-based access control, the
  ServiceNow instance is accessible from any IP address, increasing exposure
  to brute force attacks, credential stuffing, and unauthorized access from
  unexpected locations.

  Configure IP access control to restrict instance access to known corporate
  IP ranges, VPN exit points, and trusted networks. Implement IP allowlisting
  for admin access at a minimum. Consider using ServiceNow's IP address
  access control in combination with SSO for defense-in-depth.
