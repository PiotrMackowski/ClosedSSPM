title: "Integration or service users with admin role"
description: >
  An integration user or service account has been assigned the admin role.
  Integration users with admin access are a critical risk because they often
  use static credentials (basic auth), are not subject to MFA, and their
  credentials may be stored in external systems. If compromised, the attacker
  gains full system access.

remediation: >
  Remove the admin role from all integration and service accounts. Create
  dedicated roles with only the minimum permissions required for each
  integration's specific use case. Use OAuth with scoped tokens instead of
  basic auth where possible. Document each integration user's purpose and
  required permissions.
