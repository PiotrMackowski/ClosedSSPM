id: SNOW-ACL-007
title: "ACL rule with no description"
description: >
  An active ACL rule has no description field set. While not a direct security
  vulnerability, undocumented ACLs are difficult to audit and maintain. They
  increase the risk of misconfiguration during changes.
severity: LOW
category: ACL
platform: servicenow
query:
  table: sys_security_acl
  field_conditions:
    - field: "description"
      operator: "empty"
    - field: "active"
      operator: "equals"
      value: "true"
remediation: >
  Add a clear description to all ACL rules explaining what they protect, why
  they exist, and what roles/conditions are expected. This aids in security
  reviews and change management.
