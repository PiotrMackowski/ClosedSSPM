title: "Roles with no assignable_by restriction"
description: >
  A role has no assignable_by restriction, meaning any admin can assign it to
  any user without secondary approval. For sensitive roles, the assignable_by
  field should be set to limit who can grant that role, enforcing separation
  of duties.

remediation: >
  Set the assignable_by field on all elevated privilege roles to restrict who
  can grant them. This enforces separation of duties and prevents a single
  admin from unilaterally escalating privileges. At minimum, elevated roles
  should require assignment by a security_admin role holder.
