  A user account is marked as an internal integration user. These accounts
  are used for system-to-system communication and should be inventoried
  and audited regularly. Each integration user should have a documented
  purpose, minimal role assignments, and credential rotation policy.

  Maintain an inventory of all internal integration users with documented
  owners, purposes, and required permissions. Implement credential rotation
  on a regular schedule (at least every 90 days). Assign only the minimum
  roles required. Monitor API usage patterns for anomalies. Deactivate
  integration users for retired integrations.
