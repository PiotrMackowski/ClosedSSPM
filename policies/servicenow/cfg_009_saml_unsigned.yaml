title: "SAML identity provider with unsigned assertions"
description: >
  A SAML 2.0 identity provider configuration does not require signed
  assertions. Without assertion signing, an attacker who can intercept
  SAML responses can forge authentication assertions, bypassing SSO
  authentication entirely. This is a critical authentication bypass risk.
severity: CRITICAL
category: Instance Config
platform: servicenow
query:
  table: saml2_update1
  field_conditions:
    - field: "want_assertions_signed"
      operator: "not_equals"
      value: "true"
    - field: "active"
      operator: "equals"
      value: "true"
remediation: >
  Enable assertion signing on all active SAML identity provider configurations
  by setting want_assertions_signed to true. Coordinate with the IdP
  administrator to ensure the IdP is configured to sign assertions.
  Use SHA-256 or stronger signing algorithm. Test SSO login after
  enabling assertion signing to verify proper configuration.
