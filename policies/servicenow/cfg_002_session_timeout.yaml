  indicates an excessively long or unlimited session timeout. Long session
  timeouts increase the window for session hijacking and leave unattended
  workstations vulnerable.

  Set glide.ui.session_timeout to 30 minutes or less for standard users.
  Consider shorter timeouts for admin sessions. Implement re-authentication
  for sensitive operations. The recommended value is 15-30 minutes
  depending on the security classification of the instance.
