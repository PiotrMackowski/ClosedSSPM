title: "REST message using basic authentication"
description: >
  An outbound REST message is configured to use basic authentication. Basic
  auth transmits credentials in a reversible Base64-encoded format and static
  credentials are susceptible to credential theft from logs, memory, or
  configuration exports. OAuth 2.0 is the recommended alternative.

      value: "basic"
remediation: >
  Migrate outbound REST integrations from basic authentication to OAuth 2.0
  or mutual TLS. If basic auth must be used temporarily, store credentials
  in a connection alias rather than directly in the REST message configuration.
  Rotate credentials regularly and monitor for unauthorized usage.
