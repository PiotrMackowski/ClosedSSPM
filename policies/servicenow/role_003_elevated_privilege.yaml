title: "Roles with elevated privilege flag enabled"
description: >
  A role has the elevated_privilege flag set to true. Elevated privilege roles
  bypass certain security checks and should be tightly controlled. Any role
  with this flag should be carefully reviewed to ensure it is intentional and
  necessary.

  Review all roles with elevated_privilege enabled. Determine if the elevated
  privilege is truly necessary. If not, disable it and use standard role-based
  access controls instead. Document the business justification for any role
  that retains elevated privileges.
