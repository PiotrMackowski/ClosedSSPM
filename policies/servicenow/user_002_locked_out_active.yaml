title: "Locked out user account still active"
description: >
  A user account is both active and locked out. This typically indicates a
  brute force attack, excessive failed login attempts, or an account that
  was administratively locked but not properly deactivated. The account
  should be investigated for compromise indicators.

  Investigate the cause of the lockout. Check login attempt logs for brute
  force indicators (multiple failed attempts from different IPs). If the
  lockout is legitimate, unlock and reset the password. If suspicious,
  deactivate the account, reset credentials, and review audit logs for any
  unauthorized access that occurred before the lockout.
