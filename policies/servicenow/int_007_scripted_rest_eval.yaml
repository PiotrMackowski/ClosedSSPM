title: "Scripted REST operation contains eval() or GlideRecord in script"
description: >
  A scripted REST API operation contains potentially dangerous script patterns
  such as eval() calls. These patterns in REST-accessible code increase the
  risk of server-side injection if input is not properly validated.
severity: MEDIUM
category: Integrations
platform: servicenow
query:
  table: sys_ws_operation
  field_conditions:
    - field: "operation_script"
      operator: "contains"
      value: "eval("
    - field: "active"
      operator: "equals"
      value: "true"
remediation: >
  Remove eval() calls from scripted REST operation scripts. Use safe
  alternatives such as JSON.parse() for data parsing. Ensure all user
  inputs are validated and sanitized before use in any script operations.
