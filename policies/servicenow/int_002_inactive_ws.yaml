title: "Inactive web service endpoint still defined"
description: >
  A web service endpoint is defined but not active. Inactive web services
  may indicate decommissioned integrations that have not been cleaned up.
  They could be re-activated accidentally or maliciously, potentially
  exposing stale or insecure endpoints.

  Review all inactive web service definitions. Delete those that are no longer
  needed. For those that may be needed in the future, document the owner and
  purpose. Establish a regular review process to clean up unused integrations.
