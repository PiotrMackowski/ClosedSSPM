title: "MID Server not in validated status"
description: >
  A MID Server is registered but has not been validated or its validation
  has expired. MID Servers bridge the ServiceNow cloud instance to on-premises
  networks. An unvalidated MID Server could be a rogue agent introduced by
  an attacker or a legitimate server that has lost connectivity and may miss
  critical security updates.

  Validate all registered MID Servers. Investigate any MID Server that has
  lost validation — it may indicate compromise, misconfiguration, or
  connectivity issues. Remove MID Server records for decommissioned hosts.
  Ensure MID Servers are running the latest version and are monitored.
