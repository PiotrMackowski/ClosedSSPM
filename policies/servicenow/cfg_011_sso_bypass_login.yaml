title: "SSO bypass via direct login.do access not restricted"
description: >
  The system property glide.authenticate.sso.redirect.url is configured
  (indicating SSO is enabled) but the instance does not block direct
  access to login.do. When SSO is configured without restricting the
  local login endpoint, users and attackers can bypass SSO entirely by
  navigating to https://<instance>.service-now.com/login.do — defeating
  MFA, conditional access policies, and session controls enforced by the
  identity provider. This is a critical SSO bypass vulnerability.

      value: "glide.authenticate.sso.redirect.url"

remediation: >
  Restrict direct login.do access when SSO is enabled. Set the system
  property glide.authenticate.multisso.enabled to true and configure
  glide.authenticate.redirect to the SSO login page. Additionally, set
  up ACLs or property glide.security.use_sso to enforce SSO for all
  users. Consider IP-restricting login.do to internal networks only.
  Test that SSO login works correctly after applying restrictions, and
  verify that emergency local admin access is still possible via a
  documented break-glass procedure (e.g. side_door or nav_to).
