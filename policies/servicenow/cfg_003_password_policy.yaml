title: "Password policy does not enforce complexity"
description: >
  The system property glide.security.password.min_length_new or related
  password policy properties may not enforce sufficient complexity. Weak
  password policies allow users to set easily guessable passwords, increasing
  the risk of credential stuffing and brute force attacks.

remediation: >
  Set minimum password length to at least 12 characters. Enable complexity
  requirements including uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters.
  Implement password history to prevent reuse. Consider enabling SSO/SAML
  with MFA to eliminate password-based authentication entirely.
