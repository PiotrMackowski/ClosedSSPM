title: "Debug mode or logging verbosity enabled in production"
description: >
  A system property related to debug mode or verbose logging is set. Debug
  properties (e.g. glide.security.debug) can expose sensitive information
  in logs including session tokens, query parameters, and internal system
  details that aid attackers in reconnaissance.
