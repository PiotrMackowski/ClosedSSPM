title: "SAML identity provider using weak signing algorithm"
description: >
  A SAML 2.0 identity provider configuration uses SHA-1 (RSA-SHA1) as the
  signing algorithm. SHA-1 is considered cryptographically weak and is
  vulnerable to collision attacks. Modern security standards require at least
  SHA-256 for digital signatures.

remediation: >
  Upgrade the SAML signing algorithm from SHA-1 to SHA-256 or stronger.
  Update the signing_algorithm field to use RSA-SHA256 or better. Coordinate
  with the identity provider administrator to ensure both sides use the
  same algorithm. Test SSO authentication after making the change.
