title: "LDAP server connection without SSL/TLS encryption"
description: >
  An LDAP server configuration does not have SSL enabled. Without encryption,
  LDAP bind credentials (including the login distinguished name and password)
  are transmitted in cleartext. This allows network attackers to intercept
  directory service credentials via man-in-the-middle attacks.
severity: CRITICAL
category: Instance Config
platform: servicenow
query:
  table: ldap_server_config
  field_conditions:
    - field: "ssl"
      operator: "not_equals"

      value: "true"
remediation: >
  Enable SSL on all LDAP server configurations by setting ssl to true.
  Use LDAPS (port 636) or StartTLS to encrypt all LDAP communications.
  Verify that the LDAP server's TLS certificate is trusted by adding it
  to the instance trust store. Test the connection after enabling SSL.
