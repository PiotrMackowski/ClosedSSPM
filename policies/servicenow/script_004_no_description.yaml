title: "Active business rule with no description"
description: >
  An active business rule has no description field set. Undocumented business
  rules make security reviews difficult and may indicate ad-hoc changes that
  bypassed change management. All business rules should have a clear
  description explaining their purpose and security implications.

  Add a clear description to every active business rule explaining its purpose,
  the table it operates on, when it runs, and any security implications. This
  aids in security reviews, incident response, and change management. Consider
  enforcing descriptions through a change policy.
