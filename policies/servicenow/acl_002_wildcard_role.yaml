title: "ACL with wildcard role assignment"
description: >
  An ACL rule has a role requirement of '*' (wildcard/any role), which means
  any authenticated user with any role can pass this check. This is effectively
  the same as having no role requirement and should be replaced with specific
  role assignments.

  Replace the wildcard role with specific roles that should have access to the
  protected resource. Review the ACL and determine the minimum set of roles
  required based on the principle of least privilege.
