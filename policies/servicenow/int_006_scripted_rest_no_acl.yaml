title: "Scripted REST operation without ACL authorization"
description: >
  A scripted REST API operation does not require ACL authorization. Without
  ACL checks, any authenticated user can invoke the operation regardless of
  their role. Scripted REST endpoints often expose sensitive business logic
  or data and should enforce role-based access control.

query:
  table: sys_ws_operation
  field_conditions:
    - field: "requires_acl_authorization"
      operator: "not_equals"

    - field: "active"
      operator: "equals"
      value: "true"
remediation: >
  Enable ACL authorization on all scripted REST operations by setting
  requires_acl_authorization to true. Create appropriate ACL rules that
  restrict access to the required roles. Review the operation script for
  any sensitive operations that should be further restricted.
