title: "Active script include with no description"
description: >
  An active script include has no description field. Script includes are
  reusable server-side code that may be invoked from business rules, UI
  actions, or client-side scripts (if client-callable). Without a description,
  it is difficult to determine the intent and security implications during
  audit or incident response.

remediation: >
  Add a description to each active script include explaining its purpose,
  callers, expected inputs, and security implications. Prioritize documenting
  client-callable script includes, as these have the highest exposure.
